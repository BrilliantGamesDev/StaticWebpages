In "Live Trivia Tournaments" matches, you will be presented with a question, you then have a pre-set number of seconds to find the answer e.g. by finding the specific word that answers the question in a wordsearch grid (the number of seconds may change, without notice, at any time).

Prizes:

The winner of each Contest will receive any prize that is promoted for that particular contest, determined in the Promoter’s sole discretion (the “Prize”). The Promoter will distribute prizes according to the rules for the specific Contest entered. Where certain Contests have prizes that are provided by a third party, the Promoter may share information provided by you in connection with the Contest in order to facilitate the fulfilment of your prize. The terms contained within this document are general to all contests.

To receive payment of your accrued Prizes, you must cash-out Prizes through PayPal by providing a PayPal email address, a third party service. Prize fulfilment will be subject to the terms, conditions, and privacy policies of PayPal, located at https://www.paypal.com. In certain instances, involving larger Prizes, at "Live Trivia Tournaments"’s sole discretion, you will be contacted directly to receive it by a mutually agreeable method and payment will be subject to a confirmation of the winner’s eligibility to receive a Prize consistent with Promoter’s Rules and Terms of Use.

You must comply with the Rules contained within these terms at all times. Any entry by any user that does not comply with the Terms of Use, or these Contest Rules will be disqualified.

Each "Live Trivia Tournaments" user may establish, maintain, use and control only one account. Each account may only be owned, maintained, used and controlled by one individual. For avoidance of doubt, users may not “co-own” accounts. In the event the Promoter determines that you have opened, maintained, used or controlled more than one account, in addition to any other rights that the Promoter may have, the Promoter reserves the right to suspend or terminate any or all of your accounts and terminate, withhold or revoke the awarding of any Prizes.

"Live Trivia Tournaments" may use your account information (such as the email address you provided at registration) to contact and verify winners. It is your responsibility to ensure your contact details are accurate and up to date. Out of date or incorrect account information at the time we try to contact you may disqualify you from receiving a Prize. Failure to provide valid, working contact information in connection with your account may result in forfeiture of any Prizes awarded.

The Promoter expressly reserves the right to disqualify any entries that it believes in good faith are generated by an automated means or scripts or that violate any of these Contest Rules or the Terms of Use. Entries generated by script, macro or other automated means are void.

Decisions of the Promoter are final and binding with respect to all matters related to the Contest. In no event shall the Promoter be obligated to award any Prizes other than the Prize specified in these Official Rules. The Promoter does not guarantee that the Prize can be made available to the winner. The Prize is not assignable and not transferable and no substitutions are permitted. In addition, if the Prize is unable to be fulfilled to the winner due to any applicable law, rule or regulation, or if the winner cannot claim the Prize for any reason, then the Promoter reserves the right to not award the Prize at all. The winner shall be responsible and liable for all local taxes on the value of the Prize.

Prize Selection:

The Contest will be conducted under the Promoter’s supervision. The decisions of the Promoter are final and binding in all matters relating to the Contest. The winner will be notified in the "Live Trivia Tournaments" Application or by email or by phone; provided, however, that the Promoter reserves the right to determine an alternate method of notification. The winner must cash-out the Prize within 30 days after notification. A Contest winner’s failure to cash-out the Prize within the specified 30 days may be considered that Contest winner’s forfeiture of the Prize and the Promoter may, at its option and sole discretion, choose not to award the Prize at all. If an entrant is found to be ineligible, the Promoter may, at its option and sole discretion, choose not to award the Prize at all.

Colluding Players:

Colluding with other players is a forbidden activity on "Live Trivia Tournaments". The Promoter reserves the right to take any course of action that they deem appropriate to remove the impact of collusion from the game. Collusion includes but is not limited to: players in the same location watching each other’s screens to determine how to survive more rounds, or creating consortiums of players that share answers with each other. Anything the Promoter deems suspicious of the actions will be treated as collusion.

Appropriate courses of action to remove the impacts of unfair collusion may include withholding prizes won by players that colluded. Any action taken by the Promoter is final and cannot be appealed, nor will any evidence have to be provided to the User when actions such as survival point removal is taken.

"Live Trivia Tournaments":

In "Live Trivia Tournaments" contests, Players must find the answer to a question in a faster time than the opponent they are matched with.

The winner(s) of a "Live Trivia Tournaments" Contest will either be the last person remaining at the end of each complete game, or a specified number of finalist players remaining at the end of the tournament. It is the Promoters discretion how many people it wants to reward. The sponsor will seek to show the prize structure and numbers of winners in the mobile app before each contest.
