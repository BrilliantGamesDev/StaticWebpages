5. Legal basis for processing personal information?
Our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.

When we process your information based on your consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on such consent before it is withdrawn. 

To exercise your rights, see ‘Your data protection rights’ section of this Privacy Notice.


6. Cookies and similar tracking technology
We use cookies and similar tracking technology (collectively, “Cookies”) to collect and use personal information about you, including to serve interest-based advertising.  For further information about the types of Cookies we use, why, and how you can control Cookies, please see our Cookie Notice and consent management platform . 



7. How does Brilliant Games keep my personal information secure?
We use appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect the personal information that we collect and process about you. The measures we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal information. Specific measures we use include encrypting passwords in transit and at rest. 

Where you have created an account and unique password to enable you to access our Website and/or Apps it is your responsibility to keep this password secure and confidential.



8. International data transfers
In some cases your personal information is transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country you live in. These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country (and, in some cases, may not be as protective).

Specifically, our Website and App servers are located in the UK, Western Europe and the US, and our third party service providers and partners operate around the world.  This means that when we collect your personal information we will process it in any of these countries.

Where we transfer your personal information to countries and territories outside of the European Economic Area and the UK, which have been formally recognised as providing an adequate level of protection for personal information, we rely on the relevant “adequacy decisions” from the European Commission and “adequacy regulations” from the Secretary of State in the UK. 

Where the transfer is not subject to an adequacy decision or regulations, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Notice. The safeguards we use are normally the forms of standard contract authorised for the purpose by the UK Information Commissioner’s Office. 



9. Data retention
We retain the personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so. We will store and use your personal data for as long you have an account with us and for as long we consider it to be required to fulfil the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice. This means that we will use different categories of data for different periods. We will for example use contact and sign in details, gaming history and data related to your device for as long you use our Apps and play our Games, and as long as we need to provide you with your account. 

In certain circumstance, we will need to keep your information for legal reasons after your account has been deleted. The specific retention periods depend on the nature of the information and why it is collected and processed and the nature of the legal requirement. We keep your information when we have a legal obligation to do so (for example bookkeeping and financial reporting); to deal with and resolve requests and complaints (for example, if there was an ongoing complaint with respect to a service provided to you but you had deleted your account), to protect individuals’ rights (for example we will retain information about a data subject access request for one year after the request in case there is a subsequent complaint and the information is needed to demonstrate how the request was handled); and for litigation or regulatory matters (for example we would retain your information if there was an ongoing legal claim and the information was relevant to the claim. This information would be retained until the matter had been concluded.). 

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need or legal reason to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible. 



10. Your data protection rights
Depending on your location, you may have the following data protection rights.  To exercise any of them see specific instructions below or contact us using the contact details provided under the “How to contact us” heading below.

You may access, correct, update or request deletion of your personal information.  
You can object to processing of your personal information, ask us to restrict processing of your personal information or request portability of your personal information. 
You have the right to opt-out of marketing communications we send you at any time.  You can exercise this right by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link in the marketing e-mails we send you, or by turning off marketing emails in your in-App settings.
If we have collected and processed your personal information with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time.  Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
You have the right to complain to a supervisory authority about our collection and use of your personal information.  In the United Kingdom, the supervisory authority is the ICO https://ico.org.uk/global/contact-us/.
We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws.



11. Updates to this Privacy Notice
We may update this Privacy Notice from time to time in response to changing legal, regulatory, technical or business developments.
